# Naive-Bayes

The goal is to build a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch and modify it to work with discrete data. The dataset consists of 1000 data points with 2 dimensions for binary classification (y [0,1]). The values for x1 and x2 should fall within the range [0, 1].

## Implementation Details

### 1. Discrete Naive Bayes

Build a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch and adapt it to handle discrete data. The dataset provided is an example, and your implementation should work for any dataset with similar characteristics (n = 1000, d = 2, binary classification).

### 2. Laplace Smoothing

Implement the Laplace Smoothing function for the Naive Bayes class. This is crucial for handling cases where certain combinations of x1 and x2 may not be present in the training data.

### 3. Update Naive Bayes Class Functions

Modify the Naive Bayes class functions to accommodate discrete classification. Utilize the concepts learned in class to ensure proper handling of discrete features and Laplace Smoothing.
